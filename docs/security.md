# Security Best Practices

## Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use placeholder values in example configurations
- Rotate API keys and tokens regularly
- Use separate credentials for development/production

## Authentication
- JWT implementation planned for API security
- Token expiration and refresh flow
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting implementation

## Data Protection
- MongoDB Atlas encryption at rest
- TLS for all connections
- Secure webhook endpoints
- API key rotation policy

## Deployment Security
- Docker security configuration
- Network isolation
- Regular security updates
- SSL/TLS certificate management

## Monitoring & Alerts
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Database access monitoring
- System resource monitoring

## Incident Response
- Security incident classification
- Response procedures
- Contact information
- Recovery steps
