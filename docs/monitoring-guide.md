### Real-Time Metrics

The system provides real-time monitoring of key metrics:

1. **System Health Score**
   - Overall system health (0-100)
   - Thresholds: Excellent (>95), Good (>85), Needs Attention (<85)
   - Auto-refreshes every 15 seconds

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response Time: Target <50ms
   - CPU Usage: Normal (<50%), Moderate (<80%), High (>80%)
   - Memory Usage: Optimal (<70%), High (<85%), Critical (>85%)
   - System Uptime: Targeting 99.9% availability
